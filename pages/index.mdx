Tame Impala released _The Slow Rush_ last February, one of the best albums of the year by far. (Tame Impala became my most-listened artist in 2020.) Then, in the Before Times, I was living in New York City. By mid-February, I knew about the coronavirus, knew it was coming & was bad, & had made a plan for leaving the city with various levels of urgency (since I assumed NYU would shut down & I couldn’t stay in student housing). But it felt surreal, like watching a [massive wave](https://youtu.be/4Hf_XkgE1d0) roll in from the unknowable distance.

Now, coming up on a year later, listening to the opening track “One More Year” feels surreal…

There was indeed trouble in the world—though only fifty were being reported, there were [tens of thousands of cases](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/04/the-plague-year) in New York City by the time I left on March 11th. I wasn’t wearing a mask yet, I rode the subway a few times that day & got Starbucks while I was packing up my dorm room. I was the first person I knew to leave, which felt bizarre, but I assumed I’d be back in just a few weeks.

Spoiler alert: I wasn’t.

To follow my [2019 in Review](https://2019.lachlanjc.com), I’ve made this site as a chronicle of my quarantine times. I wrote my [COVID-19 Diary](https://covid19-diary.now.sh) last spring while in the thick of the early days, but this has all been written in March 2021.

I have been immensely privileged to experience COVID the way I have, which is safe, isolated, & employed remotely. Though it changed the course of my life significantly, I have not suffered, which I’m immensely grateful for.

## The first 6 weeks

The first 6 weeks of COVID had a markedly different feel, characterized mostly by uncertainty. Lacking widespread testing, our case numbers were wildly inaccurate, & the lack of PPE & basic information was staggering. I wondered if airports & highways would be closed; the world collapsed in a week, so various apocalyptic scenarios logically seemed like they could follow.

Coming back home to Pennsylvania, I was immediately joining online classes at NYU for the second half of my second semester. Some classes adapted better than others; classes that were boring in person became unmanageably dreary over Zoom. In general, I found them frustratingly useless, & ended the semester having overall learned next to nothing. We eventually got a partial refund for housing/food, but the experience was overall dismal. Teachers were doing their best & not getting any support, students were all facing their own unraveling plans.

With no clubs, events, socializing, traveling, or transportation on my schedule, online classes suddenly took up only a portion of my days. I
